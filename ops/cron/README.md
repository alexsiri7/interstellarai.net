# ops/cron

Scheduled scripts that run the archon pipeline on this machine:
- pick up new GitHub issues and dispatch archon
- keep PRs merging (rebase/fix/auto-merge)
- review PRs via archon-smart-pr-review
- watch pipeline health (CI red, zombie runs, disk pressure)
- daily release tags
- Supabase DB backups
- APK auto-sync to connected Android devices

## Secrets

Secrets are **never** committed here. Scripts load them from:

```
$ARCHON_CRON_SECRETS   (default: ~/.config/archon-cron/secrets.env, chmod 600)
```

Required keys (see individual scripts for which ones each uses):

- `ANNIE_DB_URL`, `RELI_DB_URL`, `FILMDUEL_DB_URL`, `KINDRED_DB_URL`, `LACHESIS_DB_URL` — Supabase connection strings used by `backup-dbs.sh`. Missing entries cause that DB to be skipped (not a hard failure). The URL is parsed into the libpq `PG*` environment (`lib/pg-backup.sh`) so it never appears on a command line.
- `NTFY_TOPIC` — private ntfy.sh topic for notifications. No fallback default; scripts fail loud if missing.

Set perms: `chmod 600 ~/.config/archon-cron/secrets.env`.

### pg_dump version (server is pg17)

`backup-dbs.sh` reads the server's major version first and then picks a client that is at least that new: the pinned `postgres:17-alpine` docker image (`PG_BACKUP_IMAGE`) when docker is available, otherwise a local `pg_dump` whose major version is >= the server's. Anything older is refused — `pg_dump` aborts on a version mismatch and, before #64, that abort was silently written out as a 20-byte empty archive. Pull the image once (`docker pull postgres:17-alpine`) or, without docker, install `postgresql-client-17`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y curl ca-certificates
curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg
echo "deb https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client-17
```

### What counts as a backup

Every project is dumped `--schema=public` (all five keep their tables there; the schema is verified on the server before dumping). An archive only counts when it is >= 1 KB compressed (`PG_BACKUP_MIN_BYTES`), contains a `CREATE TABLE` for the project's sanity table (`annie."Project"`, `reli.things`, `filmduel.users`, `kindred.entries`, `lachesis.lachesis_backlog`) and a `count(*)` on that table succeeds. Otherwise the artifact is deleted, the project is logged as `ERROR: <project> backup FAILED — <reason>`, the script exits 1 and ntfys (if `NTFY_TOPIC` is set). The run is summarised in `~/.archon/pipeline-health-state/db-backup-status`; `pipeline-health-cron.sh` (`check_db_backup`) ntfys once when no verified backup has landed for `DB_BACKUP_MAX_AGE_H` (7) hours. Retention (7 days local, `rclone copy --max-age 2d` to Google Drive) is unchanged.

## Parking a PR: the `hold` label

Add the `hold` label to any open PR that must stay open and unmerged (for example an asset-upload PR whose head branch another workflow fetches from). `pr-maintenance-cron.sh` skips held PRs in every phase — no draft-to-ready flip, no auto-merge, no `archon-pr-maintenance` — and `pr-review-cron.sh` fires no review at them; each tick logs `<project>: PR #N is on hold — skipping`. Remove the label to hand the PR back to the automation. `pr-maintenance-cron.sh` creates the label (`#5319E7`, "Do not auto-merge, auto-review or auto-maintain") on every repo in `archon-projects.txt` each tick, so it is always available.

## Landing a commit without CI

The cron cannot do it. `pr-maintenance-cron.sh` strips every CI-skip token GitHub honours out of the squash subject and body it composes, and `pipeline-health-cron.sh` opens a re-trigger PR against any `main` HEAD that carries one and produced no workflow run. A commit that genuinely must land on `main` without CI has to be merged by hand.

## Throttle and manual nudges

`throttle.conf` sets `TICK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (30). Each script calls `should_tick <name>` from `lib/throttle.sh`, which skips the run unless that many minutes have passed since the stamp in `~/.config/archon-cron/state/<name>.last_run`, then rewrites the stamp. To run a script by hand for one project without disturbing the schedule, set `ARCHON_CRON_FORCE_TICK=1`:

```
ARCHON_CRON_FORCE_TICK=1 ops/cron/pr-maintenance-cron.sh reli
```

Do not delete the stamp to force a run. The script rewrites it, so a nudge loop that repeats faster than the interval keeps the system cron skipping for every project the nudge did not name; a 20-minute loop did exactly that for 15 hours on 2026-09-11.

## Reading a paused run

`archon workflow resume` and the run's own log print `Workflow paused — waiting for approval.` for **every** pause, including the designed 5-minute CI wait in `archon-ship`'s deliver tail (`deliver__await-checks` / `ci-pause`). It does not mean a human gate is open — the sdlc workflow pack declares no approval node at all, and its header says so: the human gate is PR review and merge on GitHub, outside the run.

Check the run itself before acting:

```
archon workflow get <run-id> --json
```

`metadata.wait` with a `resumeAt` is a durable wait the server resumes on its own — leave it alone; resuming by hand just re-probes CI and parks again. `metadata.approval` without `resolved` is the only shape genuinely owed a response — with one exception: `type: child_workflow` means the run is blocked on a sub-run, and the child's own termination resumes the parent. An approval already `resolved` (`approved`/`rejected`) is owed a `workflow resume`, not an answer: the approver's auto-resume is a single synchronous attempt, and the server's continuation scan only ever looks at `metadata.wait`. Anything paused with none of these shapes is wedged. `check_parked_runs` resumes the two machine-owed shapes once and ntfys about the rest.

## Install the crontab

The file `crontab` in this directory is a committed reference. To install:

```
crontab ops/cron/crontab
```

It installs with absolute paths pointing at `/mnt/ext-fast/interstellarai.net/ops/cron/...`. Adjust paths there if this repo lives elsewhere on your machine.

## Script index

| Script | Cadence | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `issue-pickup-cron.sh` | every 15 min | auto-label new issues, fire `archon-fix-github-issue` on oldest queued. Dep-aware: an issue is blocked if it has any open `blocked_by` dep OR any open sub-issue child (so PRDs park themselves until all phases close, then unblock for finalization). |
| `pr-maintenance-cron.sh` | every 15 min | zero-AI PR janitor: promotes green drafts, squash-merges CLEAN, fires `archon-pr-maintenance` on one dirty/behind PR per project. Every squash merge carries an explicit subject and body built from the PR's own title and body with CI-skip tokens removed (`lib/ci-skip.sh`), so a snapshot commit on the branch cannot skip CI on `main`; a PR whose title/body cannot be read is left for the next tick rather than merged bare |
| `pr-review-cron.sh` | every 5 min | fire `archon-smart-pr-review` on open non-draft PRs, once per (repo, pr, sha) |
| `pipeline-health-cron.sh` | every 30 min | main-CI-red detection (only `push`-triggered workflows count as CI, judged on the newest run of each workflow at the current main HEAD, so a red scheduled workflow no longer reads as CI red, and a red `CI` is not masked by a `Release` that finished after it — a push-triggered deploy workflow, like `un-reminder`'s `Deploy CF Worker`, still counts as CI), prod-deploy health (status API + HTTP probe), zombie-run reaping, disk pressure, stall detection, PR-CI retry (fires `archon-assist` on open archon PRs with failed CI). Both main-CI and PR-CI remediation are scoped to the current head SHA with an attempt counter: a new SHA resets the budget, same SHA retries up to 3 times, then ntfys "factory stuck" and backs off. Main-CI issue filing additionally carries a 2h per-project cooldown (cleared whenever main goes green, so a fresh red still fires at once) and is suppressed while any open "Main CI" issue carries an `archon:*` state or a human-intent label — a human relabelling one `human-needed` used to make the cron refile it every tick. If that open issue is in a terminal `archon:*` state with nobody on it, the operator gets one ntfy instead of a duplicate issue. Red `schedule`-triggered workflows on main get an operator ntfy only — no issue, no archon, since a missing secret is not something a commit can fix (dedup per project+workflow in `scheduled-health/`, cleared on recovery). Auto-cleans caches (go/bun/npm/user-journal) before ntfying on disk pressure; files `manual-review`-labeled GH issue on 3-strike CI escalation (not re-ingested by `issue-pickup-cron.sh`). Also sweeps stale `archon:in-progress` labels off closed issues (→ `archon:done`), fires shipped-PR ntfys for merged PRs that closed issues, and ntfys when `backup-dbs.sh` has not recorded a verified backup in 7h. Watches paused archon runs (`check_parked_runs`): one `workflow resume` when a run drifts `PARKED_WAIT_MAX_SECONDS` (1800) past the resume deadline it recorded for itself, or sits at one wait for 4x that, or carries an already-resolved approval gate the engine never resumed — then one ntfy if that does not take. A run parked on an unresolved approval gate, or on a pause nothing describes, gets the ntfy straight away and never an answer. |
| `sweep-audits.sh` | 02:00 daily | rotating codebase audit (12-slot day-of-year rotation: `archon-architect` / `archon-security-audit` / `archon-test-audit` × filmduel / word-coach-annie / reli / cosmic-match) |
| `backup-dbs.sh` | every 3h (at :17) | Supabase → local + rclone to Google Drive. Verified dumps only: pinned pg17 client, schema check, min size, sanity-table row count; fails loud (exit 1 + ntfy) and deletes empty artifacts |
| `daily-release-cron.sh` | 08:00 daily | tag + release per repo if main moved since last release |
| `auto-apk-sync.sh` | every 5 min | pull latest signed APK from CI, install to any connected device |
| `apk-autosync-daemon.sh` | systemd user service | event-driven counterpart to `auto-apk-sync.sh` |
| `fetch-apks.sh` / `install-apks.sh` | manual | helper CLIs for APK ops |
| `generate-android-keystore.sh` | manual, one-off per project | generate release keystore + upload to GH Actions secrets |
| `lib/archon-projects.sh` | sourced by others | loads project list from `archon-projects.txt` |
| `lib/ci-skip.sh` | sourced by `pr-maintenance-cron.sh`, `pipeline-health-cron.sh` | the CI-skip tokens GitHub honours: detect one, strip them from a subject or a body |
| `lib/pg-backup.sh` | sourced by `backup-dbs.sh` | URL → `PG*` env, pg client/server version selection, archive validation |
| `archon-projects.txt` | data | canonical list of managed project slugs under `alexsiri7/` |
